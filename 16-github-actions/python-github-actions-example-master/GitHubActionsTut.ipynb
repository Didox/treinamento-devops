    "\n",
    "Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you commit code to your repository, you can continuously build and test the code to make sure that the commit doesn't introduce errors. Your tests can include code linters (which check style formatting), security checks, code coverage, functional tests, and other custom checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and testing your code requires a server. You can build and test updates locally before pushing code to a repository, or you can use a CI server that checks for new code commits in a repository.\n",
